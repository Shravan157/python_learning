    "#### Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction is the concept of hiding of the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary\n",
    "features of an object.  This help in reducing programming complexity and effort\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features or functionality to the user. It focuses on \"what\" an object does rather than \"how\" it does it.\n",
    "Simple analogy: When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift (simple interface) without knowing how the engine, transmission, or fuel injection works (complex implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Hide Complexity - User doesn't need to know internal workings\n",
    "Simple Interface - Provide easy-to-use methods\n",
    "Focus on Essential Features - Show only what's necessary\n",
    "Implementation Independence - Change internal logic without affecting users\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying Complex Systems - Hide complicated logic behind simple methods\n",
    "API Design - Users interact with simple functions without knowing backend details\n",
    "Database Operations - Users call save() without knowing SQL queries\n",
    "Payment Systems - Users click \"Pay Now\" without seeing encryption/banking protocols\n",
    "Frameworks & Libraries - Developers use simple functions that handle complex operations internally"
